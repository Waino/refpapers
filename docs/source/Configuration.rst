.. _Configuration:

Configuration
=============

If you run refpapers without a configuration, it will ask for the information necessary to write a minimal config.
However, to use all the features of refpapers, you should edit the configuration file.

A full-featured example configuration file can be found in
`example_conf/conf.yml <https://github.com/Waino/refpapers/blob/master/example_conf/conf.yml>`_.

Git and git-annex
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable git-annex, set :code:`use_git: True` and :code:`use_git_annex: True`.
The former speeds up indexing by using git to track when files in the data directory have changed,
and the second uses git-annex to synch files across machines.
It is not recommended to use git without git-annex, as pdfs tend to be quite big.
Git-annex uses git to index the presence of files but does not store them in the Git history, which works well for large files.

In order for git to track the files, you need to commit them into git (note that :code:`inbox` does this for you).
The option :code:`git_uncommitted` controls what to do for files that have not been commited:

* :code:`WARN`: prints a warning.
* :code:`IGNORE`: silently ignores the files when indexing.
* :code:`ADD`: sloppily indexes also uncommited files. This can in some cases cause the index to get out of synch.
  To fix, run :code:`refpapers index --full`.

Paths
~~~~~

The paths in which refpapers will look for papers or store its databases are defined in the section :code:`paths`.
In a typical setup, there are three main directories that you should be aware of

* **data**: The path to the directory where you keep your papers (PDFs). 
* **inbox**: The directory where you keep incoming papers until you run the inbox command.
  This should be separate from the above data directory. This directory is not defined in the config.
* **hidden dir**: :code:`~/.refpapers` a hidden dot-directory under your home directory. Typically contains:
    * index: "~/.refpapers/index".  The search database index.
    * log: "~/.refpapers/log".  Logfiles, if you wish to keep them.
    * api_cache: "~/.refpapers/api_cache".  Cache for metadata retrieved from web APIs, to avoid fetching the same metadata again.

Software
~~~~~~~~

You can define viewers and full-text extractors for any file types.
To support a custom file type, all you need to do is add it here.

For example, the following adds viewers for the file types :code:`*.pdf` and :code:`*.djvu`.
The latter will not have its fulltext indexed, because there is no extractor, but you can still search and view the files.

  .. code-block:: yaml

    viewers:
        pdf: "evince"
        djvu: "evince"
    extractors:
        pdf: "pdftotext -l 20"
        djvu: "None"

Extraction parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* fulltext_chars: controls how many characters from the beginning of the full-text to extract.
* ids_chars: controls how many characters from the beginning of the full-text to search for paper identifiers to use in APIs.
* extract_max_seconds: if full-text extraction takes longer than this, the file will be skipped in future indexings.
* max_authors: truncate the list of authors, by replacing the tail of the list with "etAl".
