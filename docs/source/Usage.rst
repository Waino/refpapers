Command line usage
==================

The :code:`refpapers` command line interface is divided into several subcommands, each with their own argument signature.
This is the same type of interface that e.g. :code:`git` uses.
The overall structure is :code:`refpapers <subcommand> [OPTIONS] [ARGUMENTS]`, for example :code:`refpapers search gronroos` uses the :code:`search` subcommand, with the query term :code:`gronroos`.

refpapers index
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Refresh the search index.

By deafult a fast incremental search will be used if git is enabled.
A full reindexing can be forced with the :code:`--full` flag.

refpapers rename
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Propose renaming a single file automatically.

refpapers inbox
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ingest files in inbox:

* **auto-rename** all the files in the inbox,
* **commit** the new files into git-annex,
* **sync** the contents of git-annex,
* **index** to make the new files searchable.

The :code:`--open` flag causes documents to be opened in the viewer before renaming.
If you have the papers in fresh memory, you can omit this.
Otherwise, use it to remind yourself what the paper was about.

If a paper with similar metadata is already indexed, a warning will be shown.

refpapers check
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check for data issues.


My workflow
-----------

* As I browse, I download pdfs into an "inbox" directory (separate from the main collection).
* In the inbox directory, I run :code:`refpapers inbox --open`.
    * This auto-renames all the files in the inbox, commits the new files into git-annex,
      syncs the contents of git-annex, and indexes the new files.
* On other machines, I run :code:`git annex sync --content`, and then reindex. Now the files are available on those machines as well.
* Periodically, I run `refpapers check` to check for problems.
