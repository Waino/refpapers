1.1.0 (2023-04-07)
-----------------------------------

* Layout improvements to reduce visual clutter.
* Duplicate checking.
* Possibility to override bibtex keys.
* Bugfix: Postpone import of scholarly until necessary. Failing proxies no longer prevent using other functionality.

1.0.1 (2022-27-07)
-----------------------------------

* Quality of life improvement:     Allow using control-D to skip or exit early from inbox function.

    Choosing 'skip' continues with the next paper.
    While ^C quits immediately, without syncing git annex or indexing newly
    added papers, ^D with 'exit' runs these steps before exiting.
    This is useful when the inbox is too large to ingest in one session.
* Bugfixes
